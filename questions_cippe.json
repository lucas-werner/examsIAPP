Building Block Inc. is a multinational company headquartered in Chicago with offices throughout the United States, Asia and Europe (including Germany, Italy, France and Portugal). Last year the company was the victim of a phishing attack that resulted in a significant data breach. The executive board, in coordination with the general manager, their privacy office and the information security team, resolved to adopt additional security measures. These included training awareness programs, a cybersecurity audit and use of a new software tool called SecurityScan, which scans employees' computers to see if they have software that is no longer being supported by a vendor and therefore not getting security updates. However, this software also provides other features, including the monitoring of employees' computers. Since these measures would potentially impact employees, Building Block's privacy office decided to issue a general notice to all employees indicating that the company will implement a series of initiatives to enhance information security and prevent future data breaches. After the implementation of these measures, server performance decreased. The general manager instructed the security team on how to use SecurityScan to monitor employees' computer activity and their location. During these activities, the information security team discovered that one employee from Italy was connecting daily to a video library of movies and another from Germany worked remotely without authorisation. The security team reported these incidents to the privacy office and the general manager. In their report, the team concluded that the employee from Italy was the reason why the server performance decreased. Due to the seriousness of these infringements, the company decided to apply disciplinary measures to both employees since the security and privacy policy of the company prohibited employees from installing software on the company's computers and from working remotely without authorisation."

You have just been hired by a toy manufacturer based in Hong Kong. The company sells a broad range of dolls, action figures and plush toys that can be found internationally in a wide variety of retail stores. Although the manufacturer has no offices outside Hong Kong, and in fact does not employ any staff outside Hong Kong, it has entered into a number of local distribution contracts. The toys produced by the company can be found in all popular toy stores throughout Europe, the United States and Asia. A large portion of the company's revenue is from international sales. The company now wishes to launch a new range of connected toys, ones that can talk and interact with children. The CEO of the company is touting these toys as the next big thing due to the increased possibilities offered: The figures can answer children's questions on various subjects, such as mathematical calculations or the weather. Each figure is equipped with a microphone and speaker and can connect to any smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. Any mobile device within a 10-meter radius can connect to the toys via Bluetooth as well. The figures can also be associated with other figures (from the same manufacturer) and interact with each other for an enhanced play experience. When a child asks the toy a question, the request is sent to the cloud for analysis, and the answer is generated on cloud servers and sent back to the figure. The answer is given through the figure's integrated speakers making it appear as though the toy is actually responding to the child's question. The packaging of the toy does not provide technical details on how this works, nor does it mention that this feature requires an internet connection. The necessary data processing for this has been ©2022, International Association of Privacy Professionals, Inc. (IAPP) CIPP/E Practice Exam v1.2 outsourced to a data centre located in South Africa. However, your company has not yet revised its consumer-facing privacy policy to indicate this. In parallel, the company is planning to introduce a new range of game systems through which consumers can play the characters they acquire in the course of playing the game. The system will come bundled with a portal that includes a near-field communications (NFC) reader. This device will read an RFID tag in the action figure, making the figure come to life onscreen. Each character has its own stock features and abilities, but it is also possible to earn additional ones by accomplishing game goals. The only information stored in the tag relates to the figures' abilities. It is easy to switch characters during the game, and it is possible to bring the figure to locations outside of the home and have the character's abilities remain intact."

Museum4yourSenses is a new museum with an exceptionally modern feel and is gaining a lot of traction on PluckPlack, a popular social media app. To promote their multi-location launch, founders aim to go viral with captivating avatar-enhanced videos on PluckPlack. The museum’s unique pitch is a chance for the first 100 visitors of the day to test out new virtual reality headsets for free. Visitors first step into a rainbow-colored waiting room where they receive instructions to speak their name and introduce the character they wish to become for the day. When visitors get their photo taken for their badge, they are instructed to look directly at the camera and make a funny face. A month before the museum opened in Brussels, a private reception was held. The organisers gave visitors forms that included a box to acknowledge having read the museum’s privacy notice and a consent form to sign about the images and voice recordings that would be required for entry. The consent form stated the personal data would be deleted 24 hours after the initial visit. After the Brussels launch, some of the visitors noticed the museum had posted promotional videos on PluckPlack that used the visitors’ introductory voice recordings.
