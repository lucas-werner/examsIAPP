Delilah, while filling in the standard paper application form, is asked to provide details about emergency contacts, medical history, blood type and her insurance policy. These fields need to be filled in no matter which department Delilah applies to. The form also asks Delilah to expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of her personal data. A week after submitting the form, Delilah is invited by Evan, the Director of Marketing at Good Mining, to coffee. Just before Delilah leaves, she gives her business card containing her current business contact information to Evan.

    "answer": "",
    "rationale": "Under Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), organizations must ensure that they only collect, use, and disclose personal data for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. Collecting details about Delilah's emergency contacts, medical history, blood type, and insurance policy for a marketing department job application is likely to be considered excessive and irrelevant to the job she is applying for. Thus, the form is not compliant with the PDPA because it asks for more information than is necessary for the job application process. The reason why Good Mining Private's standard form is NOT compliant with Singapore's data protection law is option D, as it asks for details that are not relevant to the job Delilah is applying for. Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) requires that organizations only collect, use, and disclose personal data for purposes that are reasonable and relevant. Asking for information such as emergency contacts, medical history, blood type, and insurance policy is not necessary or relevant to Delilah's job application in the marketing department. Therefore, it is considered excessive collection of personal data, which is a violation of the PDPA. Additionally, the collection and use of Delilah's business card for purposes other than what was explicitly agreed to by Delilah, which was to contact her for coffee, may also be a violation of the PDPA. D- breach of confidence law. Singapore provides very little legal protection to privacy outside the new PDPA. It has no explicit constitutional protections of privacy, and it is not a party to any enforceable international agreements protecting privacy. It is uncertain whether there is tort protection against harassment, but otherwise there is no tort of invasion of privacy. Some protection is provided by breach of confidence law.

Under Singapore's PDPA, organizations must ensure that personal data is only disclosed for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.

    "rationale": "Under Hong Kong's Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO), organizations are required to obtain explicit consent from individuals before using their personal data for direct marketing purposes. This means that subscribers must have explicitly indicated that they do not object to their data being used for marketing. This level of explicit consent is a higher standard compared to some of the protections in India and Singapore. SCENARIO – Please use the following to answer the next question: Zoe is the new Compliance Manager for the Star Hotel Group, which has five hotels across Hong Kong and China. On her first day, she does an inspection of the largest property, StarOne. She starts with the hotel reception desk. Zoe sees the front desk assistant logging in to a database as he is checking in a guest. The hotel manager, Bernard, tells her that all guest data, including passport numbers, credit card numbers, home address, mobile number and other information associated with a guest's stay is held in a database. Bernard tells her not to worry about the security of the database because it is operated for Star Hotels by a local service provider called HackProof, who therefore are responsible for all the guest data. Zoe notices what looks like a CCTV camera in the corner of the reception area. Bernard says they record all activity in the lobby. In fact, last Tuesday he had received a data access request from a lawyer requesting a copy of footage of all lobby activity for the preceding month. The lawyer's covering letter said that his client has never visited the hotel herself, but is investigating whether her husband has been doing so without her knowledge. Zoe and Bernard head up to the hotel spa. The spa is independently owned by a company called Relax Ltd. Bernard explains that Relax Ltd is a small company and, as they don't have their own database, they transfer data about the spa guests to StarOne staff so that they can upload the data into the HackProof system. Relax Ltd staff can then login and review their guest data as needed. Zoe asks more about the HackProof system. Bernard tells her that the server for the Hong Kong hotels is in Hong Kong, but there is a server in Shenzhen that has a copy of all the Hong Kong hotel data and supports the properties in China. The data is in China for back up purposes and also is accessible by staff in the China hotels so they can better service guests who visit their hotels in both territories."

      "D. Decline to turn over the footage as there is no basis for it to be disclosed under the exemption for prevention or detection of crime."
    ],
    "answer": "",
    "rationale": "The lawyer's request does not constitute a valid data access request under Hong Kong's Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) because the lawyer's client is not the data subject in the footage. Data access requests typically need to be made by the individual whose personal data is being requested, or by someone authorized to act on their behalf. In this case, the request is for footage to investigate the client's husband, who is the actual data subject in the footage. Exemptions While data privacy is an important right, the interests protected under PDPO have to be balanced against other important rights or public interest. PDPO provides a number of exemptions from some compliance requirements under particular circumstances. Examples include crime prevention or prosecution, security and defence, statistics and research, news activity, protecting a data subject’s health etc. There is also an exemption if the use of personal data is required or authorised by law or court order or is required for exercising or defending legal rights in Hong Kong. Prevention or detection of crime According to section 58 of the Ordinance, personal data held for the purpose of prevention or detection of a crime may be exempt from the provisions in respect of data-access requests (DPP 6 and section 18(1)(b) of the Ordinance) and restrictions on the use of personal data (DPP 3)."

SCENARIO – Please use the following to answer the next question: Fitness For Everyone (\"FFE\") is a gym on Hong Kong Island that is affiliated with a network of gyms throughout Southeast Asia. When prospective members of the gym stop in, call in or submit an inquiry online, they are invited for a free trial session. At first, the gym asks prospective clients only for basic information: a full name, contact number, age and their Hong Kong ID number, so that FFE's senior trainer Kelvin can reach them to arrange their first appointment. One day, a potential customer named Stephen took a tour of the gym with Kelvin and then decided to join FFE for six months. Kelvin pulled out a registration form and explained FFE's policies, placing a circle next to the part that read \"FEE and affiliated third parties\" may market new products and services using the contact information provided on the form to Stephen \"for the duration of his membership.\" Stephen asked if he could opt-out of the marketing communications. Kelvin shrugged and said that it was a standard part of the contract and that most gyms have it, but that even so Kelvin's manager wanted the item circled on all forms. Stephen agreed, signed the registration form at the bottom of the page, and provided his credit card details for a monthly gym fee. He also exchanged instant messenger/cell details with Kelvin so that they could communicate about personal training sessions scheduled to start the following week. After attending the gym consistently for six months, Stephen's employer transferred him to another part of the Island, so he did not renew his FFE membership. One year later, Stephen started to receive numerous text messages each day from unknown numbers, most marketing gym or weight loss products. Suspecting that FFE shared his information widely, he contacted his old FFE branch and asked reception if they still had his information on file. They did but offered to delete it if he wished. He was told FFE's process to purge his information from all the affiliated systems might take 8 to 12 weeks. FFE also informed him that Kelvin was no longer employed by FFE and had recently started working for a competitor. FFE believed that Kelvin may have shared the mobile contact details of his clients with the new gym and apologized for this inconvenience."

    ],
    "answer": "",
    "rationale": "This policy involves retaining data in an anonymous form, which is not considered personal data under the PDPO. As the data is anonymized, it no longer identifies individuals, and thus retaining it for aggregate reporting purposes does not conflict with the principles of data protection concerning accuracy and retention. DPP2 Accuracy and Duration of Retention DPP2 requires data users to take all practicable steps to ensure that personal data is accurate and is not kept longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose for which the data is used. If you engage a data processor for handling personal data of other persons, you should adopt contractual or other means to ensure that the data processor comply with the mentioned retention requirement. Section 26 of PDPO requires data users to take all practicable steps to erase personal data that is no longer required for the purpose for which the data is used, unless erasure is prohibited by law or is not in the public interest. Section 26 could be engaged when a data user fails to respond to a complaint or request from a data subject for erasure of personal data. This situation attracts a heavier criminal gravity than just keeping the data longer than is necessary under DPP2.

      "C. Law enforcement agencies.",

    "answer": "",
    "rationale": "India's Right to Information Act of 2005 provides citizens with access to information under the control of public authorities to promote transparency and accountability. However, certain security and intelligence organizations, including the National Security Guard, are exempt from the provisions of the RTI Act under Section 24, except in cases involving allegations of corruption or human rights violations. In the Central Act, section 8(1) lists all of the exemptions. • National Security or Sovereignty: As explained above, there is some information, which relates to India's national security, which could genuinely cause harm if it was released to the public. For example, information published during a conflict, detailing the number of soldiers defending a boundary, where they were positioned or their strategic plans. However, it would not be appropriate to use this exemption simply to keep a contract for the purchase of an air force fighter jet secret. This is common commercial information which should be made public to reduce the likelihood of corruption tainting the procurement process and should not be withheld simply because it relates to defense. The ‘right to information’ provided by the 2005 national legislation has a broad scope, covering ‘information held by or under the control of any Public Authority’. ‘Public authority’ includes anybody established under the Constitution, or Centre or state law, or under delegated legislation, and includes bodies owned or controlled by government or directly or indirectly substantially Financed by government (even if they are NGOs). The reach of the legislation is therefore to all tiers of government and somewhat beyond that. In 2004 India’s Supreme Court conclusively interpreted article 19(1)( a) of the Constitution of India to impliedly include the right to information in the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and expression (People’s Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India), Five years before a similar conclusion was reached in Europe. National legislation was then enacted by the Centre as the Right to Information Act 2005 (RITA). It is extremely positive that the Central Act makes all of the exemptions contained in section 8(1) subject to a \"Public Interest Override\" (see section 8(2) of the Central Act). What this means is that even where requested information is covered by an exemption, the information should still be disclosed to the applicant if the public interest in the specific case requires it. The NSG is a special forces unit under the Ministry of Home Affairs, and it may fall under the category of security and intelligence agencies which are generally exempt from the RTI Act, particularly when the information concerns matter of national security."

(i) Limitation to ‘body corporate’ and ‘commercial or professional activities. Section 43A - only APPLIES to a ‘body corporate’, which ‘means any company and includes a firm, SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP or other association of individuals engaged in commercial or professional activities. Religious and social organizations, including charities, whose activities are not classified as ‘Commercial’ will also be a substantial exclusion from the scope of the law. Although there are some public sector bodies which come within this, such as state-owned corporations, there is very limited coverage of the public sector. All of India's right to information laws contained exemptions provisions. In the Central Act, section 8(1) lists all of the exemptions. Below is a general discussion of the exemption provisions: • National Security or Sovereignty: • National Economic Interests: • Relations with Foreign States: • Law Enforcement and the Judicial Process: • Cabinet and Other Decision-Making Documents: • Trade Secrets and Commercial Confidentiality: • Personal Privacy: • Individual Safety: It is extremely positive that the Central Act makes all of the exemptions contained in section 8(1) subject to a \"Public Interest Override\" (see section 8(2) of the Central Act). What this means is that even where requested information is covered by an exemption, the information should still be disclosed to the applicant if the public interest in the specific case requires it. Only religious, social and charitable organisations and non-commercial organisations (such as government agencies) that do not engage in activities classified as \"commercial\" (hence not within the scope of \"body corporate\" in section 43A) are exempted from section 43A of the IT Act. Only activities that are not classified as \"commercial\" are not within the scope of \"body corporate\" in section 43A and hence exempt from section 43A. Religious and social, charitable organisations and government agencies do not engage in commercial activities hence are exempt. SCENARIO – Please use the following to answer the next question: Bharat Medicals is an established retail chain selling medical goods, with a presence in a number of cities throughout India. Their strategic partnership with major hospitals in these cities helped them capture an impressive market share over the years. However, with lifestyle and demographic shifts in India, the company saw a huge opportunity in door-to-door delivery of essential medical products. The need for such a service was confirmed by an independent consumer survey the firm conducted recently. The company has launched their e-commerce platform in three metro cities and plans to expand to the rest of the country in the future. Consumers need to register on the company website before they can make purchases. They are required to enter details such as name, age, address, telephone number, sex, date of birth and nationality – information that is stored on the company's servers. (Consumers also have the option of keeping their credit card number on file, so that it does not have to be entered every time they make payment.) If ordered items require a prescription, that authorization needs to be uploaded as well. The privacy notice explicitly requires that the consumer confirm that he or she is either the patient or has consent of the patient for uploading the health information. After creating a unique user ID and password, the consumer's registration will be confirmed through a text message sent to their listed mobile number. To remain focused on their core business, Bharat outsourced the packaging, product dispatch and delivery activities to a third-party firm, Maurya Logistics Ltd., with which it has a contractual agreement. It shares with Maurya Logistics the consumer name, address and other product-related details at the time of every purchase. If consumers underwent medical treatment at one of the partner hospitals and consented to having their data transferred, their order requirement will be sent to their Bharat Medicals account directly, thereby doing away with the need to manually place an order for the medications. Bharat Medicals takes regulatory compliance seriously; to ensure data privacy, it displays a privacy notice at the time of registration, and includes all the information that it collects. At this stage of their business, the company plans to store consumer information indefinitely, since the percentage of repeat customers and the frequency of orders per customer is still uncertain."

Option A is wrong, Pseudonymization REDUCES the risk of re-identification not IMPOSSIBLE Anonymization and Pseudonymization: Anonymization and pseudonymization tools help protect personal data by removing or replacing identifying information, respectively. These techniques reduce the risk of re-identification and enhance data protection while allowing organizations to use data for analytical or research purposes. Both A and C are correct. Pseudonymization helps to protect the privacy of individuals by replacing personally identifiable information with artificial identifiers, making it difficult to re-identify individuals directly. Also, by pseudonymizing the data, personally identifiable information is replaced with artificial identifiers, which reduces the risk of identifying individuals directly.

SCENARIO – Please use the following to answer the next question: Dracarys Inc. is a large multinational company with headquarters in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. Dracarys began as a small company making and selling women's clothing, but rapidly grew through its early innovative use of online platforms to sell its products. Dracarys is now one of the biggest names in the industry, and employs staff across the globe, and in Asia has employees located in both Singapore and Hong Kong. Due to recent management restructuring they have decided, on the advice of external consultants, to open an office in India in order to centralize its call center as well as its internal human resource functions for the Asia region. Dracarys would like to centralize the following human resource functions in India: 1. The recruitment process; 2. Employee assessment and records management; 3. Employee benefits administration, including health insurance. Dracarys will have employees on the ground in India managing the systems for the functions listed above. They have been presented with a variety of vendor options for these systems, and are currently assessing the suitability of these vendors for their needs. The CEO of Dracarys is concerned about the behavior of her employees, especially online. After having proprietary company information being shared with competitors by former employees, she is eager to put certain measures in place to ensure that the activities of her employees, while on Dracarys' premises or when using any of Dracarys' computers and networks are not detrimental to the business. Dracarys' external consultants are also advising the company on how to increase earnings.

Section 43A and the 2011 Rules 3-8 Rule 6: Disclosure Limitations and Exceptions ♣ SPI only: Disclosure of sensitive personal data or information by body corporate to any third party shall require prior permission from the provider of such information, who has provided such information under lawful contract or otherwise, unless such disclosure has been agreed to in the contract between the body corporate and provider of information, or where the disclosure is necessary for compliance of a legal obligation. ♣ Companies prohibited from “publishing” SPI. ♣ Third parties receiving SPI shall not disclose it further. ♣ EXCEPTION: Disclosure permitted to govt agencies mandated by law to obtain info (including SPI) for verification of ID, prevention, detection, investigation of cyber incidents, prosecution, punishment. ♣ No disclosure rights for data subject if data subject is not also provider. Disclosure limitations and exceptions (rule 6) Companies disclosing ‘sensitive personal data or information’ to any third party require prior permission from the provider of the personal data who has provided such information under lawful contract or otherwise to the body corporate. Disclosures agreed by contract between the provider of the information, or necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, are also allowed. Companies must not ‘publish’ sensitive personal information (presumably meaning they must not make it generally available to the public). Third parties receiving sensitive personal data under this Rule ‘shall not disclose it further’. Should be B - disclosure limitation. Disclosure limitation (Rule 6 of the IT rules) is an essential aspect of data protection and privacy regulations.

It subsequently became the basis for the ‘TrustSg’ trustmark administered by Singapore’s National Trust Council, a system ‘not regarded as particularly effective’, although some revocations of trustmarks have occurred. An inter-Ministry committee started to consider data protection legislation in 2005, and proceeded through a series of overseas investigations, consultation papers, and submission rounds. Chesterman sees the primary motivations for the Singapore legislation as ECONOMIC An inter-Ministry committee started to consider data protection legislation in 2005, and proceeded through a series of overseas investigations, consultation papers, and submission rounds. The PDPA which emerged from the process is in most respects the same as the draft Bill announced earlier in 2012 by the then Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, which confirmed many features foreshadowed in a previous discussion paper. However, other features were jettisoned, generally resulting in improved privacy protections. Chesterman sees the primary motivations for the Singapore legislation as ECONOMIC, rather than civil liberties or consumer protection, concerns which aim to increase the flow of personal data into Singapore by making it become a ‘trusted node’. Whether the Act will or should succeed in creating such international trust is arguable、 One of the purposes of the PDPA is to “increase consumer trust and strengthen Singapore's position as a trusted global data hub.” The motivation behind enacting the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) was primarily to boost Singapore's reputation as a trusted hub for businesses, thereby enhancing its economic competitiveness. The comprehensive data protection law aimed to foster consumer trust in businesses handling personal data, which is crucial for the growth of the digital economy and attracting international business operations."

    "rationale": "The protection of children's data is NOT explicitly mentioned in the privacy laws of Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. Here's a breakdown: Sensitive data: All three jurisdictions have provisions for the protection of sensitive personal data, although the specifics may vary. Outsourced data: Privacy laws in these countries typically address data protection responsibilities when data is outsourced to third parties. Extraterritorial data: The privacy laws may include provisions that apply to data collected or processed outside their borders but related to their citizens or residents. However, specific protections for children's data, such as age-based consent requirements or specific regulations targeting the collection and use of data from minors, are not explicitly and comprehensively covered in the privacy laws of Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. While there may be some general protections that apply, there is not a specific, detailed focus on children's data comparable to frameworks like the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States or similar regulations in other jurisdictions. Outsourced Data India amendments were brought in the information Technology Act, 2000 to provide the measures for data protection in India which may assuage the fears of misuse of data / information being dealt with by the outsourcing industry or the IT Sector or during the e-commerce for the time being.. Hongkong The Personal Data (Privacy) (Amendment) Ordinance 2012 provides enhanced protection in this respect by introducing, with effect from 1 October 2012, additional obligations on data users to use contractual or other means to monitor their data processors' compliance with data protection requirements. Singapore the relevant obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and key considerations for organisations (i.e., Data Controllers) which outsource data processing activities to other entities (i.e., Data Intermediaries). Data Controllers (DC) that ensure accountability1 through their management of Data Intermediaries (DI) provide greater assurance for customers and enhance their business Children's data India Section 9 of the PDPA specifically deals with the processing of the personal data of a child. It states that before any such processing takes place, verifiable consent needs to be taken from the parent of the child. Hongkong The Special Needs of Children Children are often identified as a vulnerable group who have special requirements in privacy protection, particularly in the context of online activities. When interacting with children, data users should bear in mind children’s vulnerability and consider adopting the following age-appropriate approaches to make sure that they protect and respect children’s personal data. Singapore's Personal Data Protection Commission released an advisory guide on how to comply with the children's privacy rules in the Personal Data Protection Act of 2012. Extraterritorial effect SINGAPORE The Act has extraterritorial effect, meaning it applies to organizations collecting, using or disclosing personal data in Singapore whether or not the organization itself has a physical presence or is registered as a company in Singapore. India While the DPDP Act is applicable to Indian entities which engage in the processing of personal data, it also has extra-territorial applicability, applying to foreign entities who offer goods and services to Data Principals (as defined below) located within the territory of India and process personal data in connection to such activities. Hongkong The PDPO does not have extraterritorial effect and only applies to data users who control the collection, holding, processing or use of PI Should be D. Extraterritorial data refers to data that is stored or processed outside the jurisdiction where the privacy laws apply.

    "answer": "",
    "rationale": "Crosscut shredding is more secure than strip-shredding because it cuts the paper into smaller pieces, making it much more difficult to reconstruct the original document. For electronic files, simply deleting or reformatting may not be sufficient, as the data can often be recovered using specialized software. Proper destruction of electronic data typically requires methods like overwriting, degaussing, or physically destroying the storage media. Legal Requirements related to Personal Data Erasure Section 26 of the Ordinance provides that a data user must take all practicable steps to erase personal data held when the data is no longer required for the purpose (including any directly related purpose) for which it was used, unless any such erasure is prohibited under any law or it is in the public interest not to have the data erased. Safe and Secure Erasure Guidelines, and in some cases, procedures, should be established on the erasure method to be used for each type of records. The purpose of the erasure is to irreversibly delete or destroy the personal data so that it cannot be recovered. The method used must, therefore, match with the type of storage technology. For example, in the case of paper records, cross-cut shredding should be used instead of strip shredding so that individual sheets cannot be easily reconstructed.

    "rationale": "While employees can be held liable for personal actions, if they are acting strictly according to the management processes and policies set by their employer, the primary liability typically falls on the organization, the corporate officers, or managers responsible for setting up or overseeing data processing and handling. In contrast, employees who are simply following these established processes without deviation are generally not held individually liable. Personal liability of corporate officers for offences The Act imposes personal liability on company officers for offences, an unusual provision in a data protection law: ‘Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved — (a) to have been committed with the consent or connivance of an officer; or (b) to be attributable to any neglect on his part, the officer as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly’ (s52(1)) Personal and vicarious liabilities Singapore’s Act raises important issues for businesses trading in Singapore concerning who is liable for breaches and offences. Liability of employers - Any act done or conduct engaged in by an employee in the course of his or her \"employment shall be treated as done or engaged in by the employer as well, whether or not it was with the employer's\" knowledge or approval Excluded organisations - The PDPA provides that the Data Protection Provisions do not impose any obligations on the following entities. These categories of organisations are therefore excluded from the application of the Data Protection Provisions: a) Any individual acting in a personal or domestic capacity; b) Any employee acting in the course of his or her employment with an organisation; and c) Any public agency Individuals acting as employees The second significant exclusion for individuals in the PDPA relates to employees who are acting in the course of their employment with an organisation. Employees are excluded from the application of the Data Protection Provisions. The PDPA defines an employee to include a volunteer. Hence, individuals who undertake work without an expectation of payment would fall within the exclusion for employees. Case - Michael Reed vs Alex Bellingham vs Attorney-General ( Judith Prakash JCA -delivering the judgment of the court) Application of Act 4.—(1) Parts 3, 4, 5, 6, 6A and 6B do not impose any obligation on — (a) any individual acting in a personal or domestic capacity; (b) any employee acting in the course of his or her employment with an organisation; (c) any public agency; or (d) any other organisations or personal data, or classes of organisations or personal data, prescribed for the purposes of this provision. On this point, the appellant supports the Judge’s holding. In his submissions, the appellant accepts that if s 4(1)(b) of the PDPA applies, the respondent is not liable for any breach of ss 13 and 18 committed in the course of his employment. The liability would be that of the person who employed the respondent when he committed the breaches. Should be B. Any act done or conducted or engaged in by an employee in the course of their employment will be treated as done or engaged in by the employer. This includes volunteers, interns and trainees. However, it is a defense for the employer to prove that it took such steps as were practicable to prevent the employee from doing the act or engaging in the misconduct."

Employers should only collect data that is necessary and relevant to the job application process. NO to C - You can legally collect the rest - A, B &D - B is not relevant for the employment purpose... The main objective of the Purpose Limitation Obligation is to ensure that organisations collect, use and disclose personal data that are relevant for the purposes, and only for purposes that are reasonable. Consistent with the Notification Obligation, the Purpose Limitation Obligation also limits the purposes for which personal data may be collected, used or disclosed to those which have been informed to the individuals concerned pursuant to the Notification Obligation (where applicable). A potential employer can collect personal data about an employee (such as A, B and D) for EVALUATIVE purpose, i.e. hiring decision, promotion, continue or terminate their employment, without their consent and without notification."

Giving publicity to intimate information about an individual without his consent can prejudice his ability to maintain social relationships and pursue his career. For instance, publishing the fact that a woman is mentally retarded, a lesbian, a prostitute, a drug addict, a transsexual, illegitimate, a patient receiving treatment for breast cancer, or an attendant in a nightclub may make it difficult for her to maintain a normal relationship with her acquaintances and family members. Thus, an individual may not want others know that he is a prodigy, a subscriber to a philanthropic society, or a wealthy person. Individuals who are grief-stricken and public figures who have suffered a setback are particularly vulnerable to mental distress caused by unwanted publicity."

      "A. Notice; because the data subject must be provided with the purpose of the collection.",
      "B. Public domain; because the data subjects must agree to the purpose before their information is made publicly available.",

    ],
    "answer": "",
    "rationale": "Under DPP3 of the PDPO, personal data must not be used for a new purpose unless the data subject has given prescribed consent. This means that if an organization wishes to use personal data for purposes beyond what was originally stated at the time of collection, they must obtain explicit consent from the data subject. This provision strengthens the purpose limitation principle by ensuring that personal data is only used in ways that the data subject has explicitly agreed to. DPP3 Use of Data DPP3 prohibits the use of personal data for any new purpose which is not or is unrelated to the original purpose when collecting the data, unless with the data subject’s express and voluntary consent. A data subject can withdraw his/her consent previously given by written notice. Regarding restrictions on use of personal data, Part 6A of the PDPO further requires that data users must obtain informed consent before using a data subject’s personal data for direct marketing or transferring the data to a third party for direct marketing. The consent must be an explicit indication by the data subject and broadly covers an indication of no objection. In other words, silence cannot constitute consent. This provision ensures that individuals explicitly consent to any additional purposes for which their personal data will be used beyond the original purpose of collection, thus reinforcing the principle of purpose limitation."

This ensures that individuals are fully aware of and agree to the specific use of their personal data, rather than giving broad consent without proper understanding. “bundled consent” obtained by the Bank(data controller/data user) cannot be regarded as an express consent, hence falling outside the definition of “prescribed consent”.

Section 43A and the 2011 Rules 3-8 In 2011, delegated legislation made under section 43a of the IT Act created a data privacy regime. However, the rules are perhaps ultra vires, apply only to very strict definitions of sensitive data, and provide rights of action only to the “providers of data”. Rule 8: Reasonable Security “Such security practices and standards have a comprehensive documented info sec program and info sec policies that contain managerial, technical, operational, and physical security control measures that are commensurate with the info assets being protected with the nature of business.” “In the event of an info sec breach, the body corporate … shall be required to demonstrate [to agency] that they have implemented security control measures as per their documented info sec program and policies.” Burden of proof in R8 likely does not override 43A’s standard of negligence.

In doing so, it overruled previous judgments of the Supreme Court in M.P. The Supreme Court, through six separate opinions, pronounced privacy to be a distinct and independent fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution.

    "answer": "",
    "rationale": "Under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore, organizations are required to notify affected individuals if a data breach is likely to result in significant harm to them. This requirement ensures that individuals are made aware of breaches that could have a considerable impact on their privacy or security, allowing them to take necessary precautions. While similar provisions exist in some jurisdictions, this specific requirement provides a clear mandate for informing individuals under defined circumstances, offering a distinct layer of protection for Singapore residents. Singapore - Under the current Act A data breach constitutes a “notifiable data breach” if: it results in, or is likely to result in, significant harm to the affected individuals (including one that compromises personal data prescribed under the Personal Data Protection (Notification of Data Breaches) Regulations 2021); or it is of a significant scale (i.e. one that affects 500 or more individuals). Hongkong - There is no statutory definition of a data breach under the Ordinance. India - “In the event of an info sec breach, the body corporate … shall be required to demonstrate [to agency] that they have implemented security control measures as per their documented info sec program and policies.” Under the DPDP Act, in the event of a personal data breach, Data Fiduciary is required to inform each affected Data Principal Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (\"IT Act\") required a body corporate that possesses, deals with or handles any \"sensitive personal data or information\" in a computer resource which it owns, controls or operates, to maintain \"reasonable security practices and procedures\". The terms \"sensitive personal data or information\", and \"reasonable security practices and procedures\" were not sufficiently defined. Exemption For Outsourcing Entities: The obligations under Rules 5 and 6 of the Data Privacy Rules (i.e., relating to the manner in which companies can collect and disclose \"sensitive personal data or information\") do not apply to Indian companies which collect, store, deal with or handle \"sensitive personal data or information\" under a contractual obligation with a legal entity."
