(IAPP)                                CIPM Practice Exam v1.1    SCENARIO I  Please use the following scenario to answer the next TWO questions.  You have recently been hired on as privacy officer for a newly-formed, privately-funded kidney dialysis company based in Boston, Massachusetts in the U.S., with subsidiaries in Dublin, Ireland and Dubai, UAE. The company’s focus is on utilizing artificial intelligence software to manage and enhance care for end-stage kidney disease patients around the world by analyzing patient data and making predictions that allow “right care at the right time”. Most of the company’s employees will be located within close proximity to the three main offices; however, the sales team, which makes up approximately one-third of the workforce, will have the ability to work remotely full-time since much of their work will be spent travelling to customer locations to demonstrate and train on the new software. While headquartered in the U.S., the company delegates broad decision-making authority to its two subsidiaries, allowing the subsidiaries to have control of their day-to-day business functions. As part of this delegation of control, the privacy team has privacy professionals in each region to support privacy within its subsidiaries. The company has chosen to outsource its information security functions utilizing a third-party vendor. All customer data will be stored in a cloud-based server. Access will be restricted in a manner that only allows each subsidiary to view and access customer data for their own country’s customers. For example, employees based out of Boston will not be able to access the customer data for Dubai’s clients. Certain leadership employees will be able to see across all three locations; however, their access will mainly be to non-customer-specific data.  You have a strong background in managing privacy programs in U.S. healthcare organizations. Previously, however, you have only worked at not-for-profit U.S. organizations; this will be your first time working at a for- profit global company. You will be reporting to the chief compliance officer (CCO), headquartered in Boston, who has expertise in the operations of a global kidney dialysis company and general knowledge regarding compliance regulations and laws to which the new organization will be subject. While the CCO has some knowledge of privacy laws and regulations that may impact your new organization, she will be relying on you to ensure company compliance from a privacy program management perspective. Both you and your boss’ roles will entail ensuring all subsidiaries comply with all country-specific laws, regulations and norms. You are well aware of the importance of buy-in at all levels of the leadership in order for the privacy program to be effective and are eager to show your new boss how you can apply that knowledge and expertise to ensure the company is appropriately addressing all privacy risks facing the organization."

Mollie has been a customer of a popular online retailer for a women’s fashion brand for over 10 years. Mollie is a frequent shopper and a “VIP customer.” As such, she often gets early access to sales and special offers and had a dedicated account manager, Toby. Mollie often communicated with Toby via phone, email and text about order updates, special offers or even complaints. Toby was always on hand to resolve issues and has provided excellent customer service for Mollie. Over the last year, Mollie has noticed she has had to return several items for a variety of reasons. Mollie also recently moved and has repeatedly asked for her address details to be changed on her account; however, her deliveries are still going to her old address, causing unnecessary delays. A few of the purchases Mollie returned have not been refunded to her. She even agreed to receive the refunds in the form of gift vouchers or credit applied to her account, but those have not been applied. Her account manager has been replaced by Karen, who is not as easy to contact as Toby, and who often doesn’t respond to her messages.  Mollie received a notice that her account information may have been compromised by a data breach, which the company is currently investigating. No further details about the breach have been provided to Mollie. She is becoming increasingly worried and disappointed by the lack of customer service and information provided on the data breach, considering she has been a loyal customer for many years. Because of this, Mollie has not been purchasing as many items and is worried she may lose her “VIP” customer status. Additionally, she is still owed money from many returns that have not been processed and has concerns about identity theft. Mollie reaches out to the generic customer service team rather than Karen.

SCENARIO V  Please use the following scenario to answer the next THREE questions.  A Europe-based snacking company, GoodSnack, has been driving expansion through acquisition for the last few years. As part of its expansion, it has acquired several new businesses, including:  •  HealthySnack, which offers a range of healthy snack products that are mainly sold in Europe, but has a growing customer base in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. •  PharmaSnack, the snacking division of a global pharmaceuticals giant. PharmaSnack sells a wide range of medicated products through its direct-to-consumer online portal. •  SnackAI, an India-based startup that uses artificial intelligence to predict consumer snacking behavior.  Just after it acquires HealthySnack, GoodSnack learns of a data breach that occurred in HealthySnack’s Australian division, which exposed personal data from its Australia/New Zealand customer base. The breach was traced to a third-party website where consumers were encouraged to register and post pictures of themselves with HealthySnack products. The images were then visible on HealthySnack’s social media channels. The investigation by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of New Zealand found that while the breach was attributed to a zero-day exploit, HealthySnack had failed to assess risks of the processing of consumer data by a third party.  Following a wider review by parent company GoodSnack, an internal audit has found HealthySnack to be deficient in its privacy practices—especially privacy risk assessments—and seeks to ensure all its subsidiaries have adequate privacy measures in place. You have been recruited by GoodSnack and tasked by the audit board with designing and implementing a global privacy assessment process, as well as with assessing any solutions already in use.  From your data gathering, it is clear that SnackAI’s expertise can support GoodSnack’s strategy to use artificial intelligence to target its marketing activity. Any privacy risk assessment developed for GoodSnack will need to assess the impact of AI. GoodSnack is creating a central data repository of all customer data from GoodSnack and its subsidiary companies to look for direct marketing opportunities. GoodSnack also intends to share data with SnackAI to develop a customer-specific pricing and discount model based on previous purchase history.    ©2024, International Association of Privacy Professionals, Inc.

A global media company that operates through various outlets in fifteen countries and four continents is undergoing a global restructure. Traditionally, the business has operated in each country as a separate entity.  The business plans to pivot to a global structure to take advantage of economies of scale, streamlining teams and products and to create a unified customer database across all markets. Sharing data and information globally has increased risks to data privacy, and the global leadership team has recognized the need to create a global privacy program headed by a board-level chief privacy officer.  Prior to the restructure, there was no global privacy program, as each market operated its own privacy program with its own databases and systems. Personal data and processes were not shared across the global business between different markets or the global headquarters.  While the different markets are at varying levels of data privacy maturity, the new global CPO recognizes that each local market has data privacy teams with skills and knowledge pertinent to their region’s regulatory environment and the local business unit’s culture. The goal is to create global cross-functional teams operating at all levels of the business. Therefore, there is a strong need to create a new global data privacy vision from the start of the restructure to embed and instill a strong privacy ethic from the start.  The new CPO wants to operate a hybrid data governance structure that will harness some of the existing privacy programs but with a central global privacy team that defines the new privacy vision, who will communicate the new privacy program to the whole global business.  The new sales and marketing department will be based in the U.S. and will be responsible for global sales targets and growing subscriptions of the business’s various subscription-based media products. The new global subscriber databases will also be based in the U.S., with current and prospective subscribers targeted in the global database and email marketing platform.  The business still has a privacy notice for each local market’s websites, which does not describe the new way customer data is shared with different parts of the business in different countries, and each privacy notice is written to reflect the data privacy laws of that particular country. The business still has separate HR teams in each market with their own internal privacy policies.  A privacy program director has been recruited to the new global privacy team to support the CPO, and is responsible for communicating the new global privacy program across the business and running training and awareness programs.   ©2024, International Association of Privacy Professionals, Inc.

It is not necessary to conduct a PIA when restructuring personnel in an organization. Body of Knowledge Domain III, Competency E  ©2024, International Association of Privacy Professionals, Inc.

A corporate website in a large organization with many customer-facing websites would not reach as many people as having a unified privacy statement across all privacy notices. An awareness campaign would also not have the lifespan of a statement permanently linked to all websites.

Appointing a chief privacy officer (CPO), if one did not already exist, is another example of a proactive organization and indicates a company that takes privacy seriously. However, merely appointing a CPO would not remediate the damage to the bank customers, nor will it reduce the risk of their personal data being maliciously used. Issuing a press release with the details of the investigation is typically done as a part of the ongoing updates the bank would do while the incident is still ongoing.

After searching on the internet for vacation timeshares a few months ago, the number of timeshare advertisements continued to progressively populate on the family computer of Jared and Melissa Stark. After much hesitation, they decided to accept an offer from Marisol Multipropiedad, headquartered in Barcelona, Spain. With numerous properties throughout the Caribbean and other tropical locations around the world, Marisol Multipropiedad welcomed the Starks to one of their properties in Playa del Carmen, Mexico for a free four-night vacation if they supplied their own airfare. After Jared conducted a little research on the legitimacy of the company, they decided to accept the offer and began to provide Marisol Multipropiedad with a significant amount of personal data to secure the reservation, including contact information and financial details. Although one of the conditions of acceptance to the offer was to attend a day-long seminar and tour of the nearby time-share properties, the Starks needed a vacation and booked a flight from Denver, Colorado later that evening.  Roughly a month later, the Starks arrived in Cancun and were escorted to a passenger van with a few other couples and left the airport toward the vacation property 45 minutes south. The presentation for the time- share was scheduled for 9AM on Monday.  As Jared and Melissa entered the presentation room, they were each handed a tablet to begin filling out a questionnaire about spending habits, income and savings information, and which level and price range of timeshare ownership they were interested in with Marisol Multipropiedad. Secondly, they were directed to a different website for the actual resort, El Playacar del Mar, based in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, and asked to fill ©2024, International Association of Privacy Professionals, Inc. (IAPP)                                CIPM Practice Exam v1.1    out a variety of personal data (address, email address, generic financial information regarding their savings and investments). Neither the website nor the questionnaire contained a privacy statement.  Jared asked why he had to provide information when he had already given to Marisol. He was told that there may be limitations on access to that information, depending on the membership level they choose, and that smaller local companies may require information be provided directly to them.  Leaving the presentation, Jared and Melissa felt a little too pressured to purchase a timeshare membership at that time and planned to discuss matters when they returned home. Once home, the pressure to buy really intensified. Within weeks, both of their email inboxes were flooded with timeshare opportunities from an array of companies they had never heard of, but claimed to be a part of the Marisol Multipropiedad network, while others seemed to have no affiliation whatsoever. Pretty soon, offer after offer began arriving in the mailbox and telemarketing calls seemed to come at all hours. Jared finally had enough and decided to contact Marisol Multipropiedad to have them delete all of their personal information and to never be contacted again."
